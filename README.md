# Electricity Consumption Prediction

This project focuses on building a model to predict electricity consumption using historical data and various features that influence energy usage. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and employs data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- ![Data Cleaning Icon](icons/data-cleaning.png) **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations to prepare a clean dataset.
- ![EDA Icon](icons/eda.png) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data through statistical and graphical methods.
- ![Feature Engineering Icon](icons/feature-engineering.png) **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones for the prediction task.
- ![ML Models Icon](icons/ml-models.png) **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing algorithms to predict electricity consumption, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- ![Evaluation Icon](icons/evaluation.png) **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- ![Visualization Icon](icons/visualization.png) **Visualization**: Displaying consumption trends, feature importance, and model performance through graphs and charts.

## Installation
1. ![Clone Icon](icons/clone.png) Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/electricity-consumption-prediction.git
    ```
2. ![Navigation Icon](icons/navigation.png) Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd electricity-consumption-prediction
    ```
3. ![Install Icon](icons/install.png) Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. ![Jupyter Icon](icons/jupyter.png) Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook electricity-consumption.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
3. Modify or extend the code to use custom datasets or apply different algorithms.

## Dataset
![Dataset Icon](icons/dataset.png) The dataset contains historical electricity consumption data with features such as:
- Date and Time
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Day of the Week
- Holiday Information

**Note**: Replace the placeholder dataset with your own data or specify the dataset used for this project.

## Results
- The project achieves accurate predictions with a model that generalizes well on unseen data.
- Feature importance analysis reveals the key drivers of electricity consumption.
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual consumption demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.
